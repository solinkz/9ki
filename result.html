                                            9 Fire can exhibit both the Yin and Yang aspects of Fire.  At times internal and withdrawn, the Yin aspect will be exhibited like a warm glowing ember ready to ignite the fuel around in an instant.  The Yang aspect will be displayed as the brilliant, clarifying nature of a leader.  Fire people need the support of Tree energy, with creative ideas and sincere appreciation.  Nine Fire people will innately have a deep understanding for each other.  Those in Tree position will be supportive of the 9 Fire, but may be drained by them if either is out of balance.  Earth energy will drain and can "snuff out" the Fire person's enthusiasm, but may also be able to contain the overexuberance or explosive tendencies.  Metal people will drain the energy also, just as Fire gives of itself to temper Metal.  If Fire is missing in the group dynamics, it will be a good idea to add this element in the form of color, shape, item or people with Fire element in order that the group is balanced, healthy and energetic.  Fire element is sunlight, exercise, people, animals, even the written word.

                                            1 Water people carry both aspects of the element:  feminine and masculine, yin and yang.  The Water people can be deep and brooding, intuitive and diplomatic, or bubbly, chatty and social.  If out of balance, these folks can exhibit water's unbounded flow, depth that can lead to depression.  The aspect of this person that fall in this element is enhanced and  supported by Metal Energy and supports those with Tree Energy.   People with numbers in this area together seem to understand each other very well, as though they are coming from the same cloth.  Your level of trust, faith and honor of each other is deeply rooted, although you may not know why.  There is little friction or antagonism between you.   If the graphic shows no names in this area, this will be one of the elements that you may need to add to the environment.  If there are names within the "Tree" area, you will especially want to add this energy to support those people when in relationship to the others in the group.

                                            2, 5, and 8 are the numbers for the Earth Element.  2 Yin, 5 Center and 8 Yang have grounding qualities that differ between the numbers.  Where 2 is mothering and nourishing, 8 is deeply grounding, research oriented and loyal/stubbor, 5 is the number of the administrator or go to person for advice and direction.  All Earths will have a similar grounding and nourishing aspect and feel comfortable with each other; the caveat is to be aware that there is a balance of the other energies in the space and group to make sure these people do not become overly detail oriented, fixed and stubborn, or lethargic and smothering.  Support Earth with Fire energy to shine the light on which details are important and Metal energy (deadlines, commerce, travel) to prevent over focus on details, research or "bossing others around."  Water energy will muddy Earth's solidity, and Earth will give boundaries and containment to Water's fluid and meandering ways.  Tree energy can drain the enthusiasm of Earth by providing too many ideas to bring to conclusion.   If there are no names in this area, add this energy to your spaces with the colors, shapes and items associated with earth, to make certain that your group is grounded and can receive and use the nourishment and digest ideas, relationships and experiences.

                                            9 Fire can exhibit both the Yin and Yang aspects of Fire.  At times internal and withdrawn, the Yin aspect will be exhibited like a warm glowing ember ready to ignite the fuel around in an instant.  The Yang aspect will be displayed as the brilliant, clarifying nature of a leader.  Fire people need the support of Tree energy, with creative ideas and sincere appreciation.  Nine Fire people will innately have a deep understanding for each other.  Those in Tree position will be supportive of the 9 Fire, but may be drained by them if either is out of balance.  Earth energy will drain and can "snuff out" the Fire person's enthusiasm, but may also be able to contain the overexuberance or explosive tendencies.  Metal people will drain the energy also, just as Fire gives of itself to temper Metal.  If Fire is missing in the group dynamics, it will be a good idea to add this element in the form of color, shape, item or people with Fire element in order that the group is balanced, healthy and energetic.  Fire element is sunlight, exercise, people, animals, even the written word.

                                            6 and 7 are Metal Energy Numbers.  6 is the Yang aspect associated with "Father" energy of duty, honor, accountability and sharpness.  The 7 Metal is the Yin (feminine aspect) of Metal called "Joyful Lake" and loves beauty and beautiful surroundings, entertaining and would be interested in diplomacy and how things look, as seem to need to learn from experience rather than caveat.  The 6 and 7 Metal people will have an understanding of each other, both interested in how the harvest is gathered and accounted for, but will have different ideas about how to relate to others, the 6 being accountable and the 7 being diplomatic.  Support the Metal folks with Earth energy, and take the edge off their rigidity or overly-judgmental moods by adding water to allow them to flow more smoothly through the day and events.  Tree energy may frustrate Metal's need for deadlines and producing results, but may also, if done with humor (fire energy) allow the Metal people to see that everything is not always so serious and rigid.  Add Fire energy (humor, sunshine, exercise, people) to uplift and take the "edge" off Metals tendency to become surgically rigid.  If metal is missing in the group dynamics, be sure to add this element in order to bring your product to the world, be supportive  of and supported by community, help to become global citizens and travel outside of your own environment.
